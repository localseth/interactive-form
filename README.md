## Helper Functions
### focusOrBlur(domElement, status)
This function allows you to set focus or blur on a DOM element defined in the parameters. You pass in the element and either a string 'focus', or 'blur.'
### showHide(domElement, displayStatus)
This function is like focusOrBlur but accesses the display style attribute. The string `'none'` will cause the element to be hidden, and an empty string will cause the element to return to its original state.
